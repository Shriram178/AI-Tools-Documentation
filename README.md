# My Journey with AI Development Tools: A Personal Experience with Bolt.new, V0 Vercel, and Cursor AI

## Introduction

When I decided to build an apartment booking application, I knew I wanted to leverage AI tools to accelerate development. After experimenting with three major AI development platforms - Bolt.new, V0 Vercel, and Cursor AI - I've gained valuable insights that I want to share. This document chronicles my hands-on experience, what worked, what didn't, and the lessons learned that could help other developers navigate the AI-powered development landscape.



## The Foundation: Learning How to Prompt Effectively

### My Initial Mistakes

In the beginning, I approached AI tools with vague, overarching descriptions. I would prompt something like: "I want to create an apartment booking app where the admin can do this and user can do this, these are the conditions..." But I quickly realized I was leaving critical details undefined. For instance, I hadn't clearly thought through how cancellation requests would behave differently for individual bookings versus team bookings.

For a more general example, imagine an online store. You might describe it simply as: "I want an e-commerce app where users can buy products and admins can manage inventory." That sounds clear at first, but without specifying details—like how returns would differ for digital products versus physical ones—the AI may make assumptions that don’t align with your real requirements.

### The Game-Changing Realization

I learned that **you cannot blindly trust AI to handle undefined requirements**. The most crucial insight was that the SRS (Software Requirements Specification), requirement documents, and design documents should be created by us with minimal AI assistance. During this documentation phase, you naturally discover gaps in your understanding rather than leaving them for the AI to guess.

### My Winning Strategy

After completing all the planning documents and Figma designs, I had a crystal-clear vision of what I wanted to build. Since I planned to use AI for UI creation, I focused heavily on creating comprehensive API documentation with detailed response structures. I also included coding guidelines, such as centralized API format where all endpoints would be written in one file and imported into pages.

**My exact prompting workflow:**
1. **Initial Context**: Give the AI the entire application concept and structure (number of pages, basic functionalities)
2. **Detailed Specifications**: For each subsequent prompt, provide a detailed page specification document along with the specific endpoints and request/response structures needed
3. **Visual Reference**: Include images of expected UI when available
4. **Incremental Development**: Handle one page at a time with complete specifications

For example, when working on the booking page, I provided:
- An image of the expected UI design
- Detailed feature specifications for the booking functionality  
- All required endpoints with request/response examples
- Integration requirements

**This approach worked exceptionally well for me.**


## Bolt.new: Fast Prototyping with High Token Costs

### What Worked Well

Bolt.new excelled at creating React projects quickly and handling basic to medium complexity prototypes. The platform was particularly effective at:
- **Rapid MVP Development**: Getting a working prototype up and running faster than other tools
- **Integration Capabilities**: Successfully connecting endpoints with request/response structures when provided with clear specifications
- **React Project Generation**: Creating well-structured React applications with proper folder organization

### The Token Consumption Problem

However, Bolt.new's biggest drawback was its excessive token usage. The platform consumed enormous amounts of tokens for relatively simple tasks:
- **Reading Prompts**: Even processing my initial prompts consumed significant tokens
- **Error Fixing**: Simple errors like missing semicolons or brackets would consume 100k+ tokens to fix
- **Version Control**: Unlike V0, reverting to previous versions in Bolt required additional tokens

**Real Example**: When I had a basic syntax error - something as simple as a missing bracket - Bolt consumed over 100,000 tokens just to identify and fix it. These are errors I could have fixed myself in seconds.

Even restoring a previous version of the code consumes tokens in Bolt.new, whereas it’s free in Vercel v0.

### My Usage Recommendation

I would use Bolt.new when:
- Building basic to medium complexity React applications
- Creating MVPs without extensive customizations
- Working on prototypes rather than full production applications
- Having a generous token budget (even the pro subscription struggles with large projects)

**Important Note**: Based on my experience, even the pro subscription tokens won't suffice for completing a comprehensive project due to the high consumption rate.


## V0 Vercel: Superior for Next.js Development

### Superior Architecture Understanding

V0 demonstrated better handling of custom components and made fewer errors overall. When errors did occur, it fixed them without consuming additional prompts - a significant advantage over Bolt.new.

### The Next.js Advantage

Since V0 was primarily trained on Next.js, it excels in this framework. While Next.js is essentially React with additional structure and capabilities (routing, server-side rendering), V0's specialized training made it significantly more effective for Next.js projects.

### Prompt Efficiency

V0's approach to prompts was refreshingly different:
- **No Token Limitations**: Everything operates on a prompt basis rather than tokens
- **8 Prompts Daily**: Free tier provides 8 prompts per day with no size restrictions
- **Large Prompt Handling**: No performance penalty for large, detailed prompts
- **Task Segmentation**: Effectively handles multi-part prompts when structured as Task 1, Task 2, etc.

### Custom Component Excellence

V0 successfully created complex custom components that Bolt struggled with. For example, it built a drag-and-drop layout builder component in Next.js with relative ease.

It’s also easy to switch between versions in V0, and unlike Bolt.new, it doesn’t consume tokens.


### Integration Limitations

While I didn't extensively test V0's integration capabilities, I found it less confident for backend development and API integration compared to Cursor AI.

### My Usage Recommendation

I would choose V0 when:
- Building Next.js applications (its sweet spot)
- Requiring highly customizable UI components
- Working on projects where prompt efficiency matters more than speed
- Building large-scale projects (prompt-based pricing is more sustainable)

## Cursor AI: The Productivity Powerhouse

### The Complete Development Environment

Cursor AI is fundamentally different - it's an AI-integrated IDE that feels like VS Code enhanced with GitHub Copilot capabilities.

### My Workflow with Cursor

**Setup Process:**
1. Created a common folder containing both frontend and backend projects
2. Opened the entire directory in Cursor
3. Included all project documents (SRS, feature specifications, API documentation, design documents) in the same directory
4. Asked Cursor to scan and understand the entire project structure

**Integration Process:**
My typical integration workflow involved:
1. Adding relevant files to the Cursor chat (e.g., `usercontroller.js` from backend, `login.tsx`, `AuthProvider.tsx`, and `api.tsx` from frontend)
2. Requesting specific integrations between backend and frontend
3. Asking Cursor to test the implementation by writing and running test cases
4. Iterative refinement until the expected functionality was achieved

### Real-World Problem Solving

**Example Issue**: We encountered a bug where API requests were successful and responses were correct, but subsequent requests would fail with "data not found" errors. The issue wasn't in the endpoint but in our database schema where a field was incorrectly set to null. Cursor identified this by analyzing the entire codebase context.

### The Productivity Multiplier

Cursor demonstrated the ability to compress what would typically be 2 days of development work into 2 hours, provided you have clear requirements. This dramatic productivity boost comes from:
- **Full-Stack Understanding**: Seamlessly working across frontend and backend
- **Contextual Awareness**: Understanding the entire project structure
- **Testing Integration**: Automatically writing and running tests to verify changes
- **Error Detection**: Identifying issues across the entire codebase

### My Usage Recommendation

Cursor AI is ideal when:
- You need comprehensive full-stack development assistance
- Working with existing codebases that require integration
- Debugging complex issues that span multiple files
- You have clear requirements and want maximum productivity
- Building production applications rather than just prototypes

## Key Insights and Recommendations

### The Importance of Preparation

**Critical Success Factor**: The most important lesson is that AI tools amplify your clarity, not replace it. The better your documentation, requirements, and specifications, the better your results will be.

### Token Economics Matter

**Bolt.new**: High token consumption makes it expensive for large projects
**V0**: Prompt-based pricing is more predictable and sustainable
**Cursor**: Subscription model provides consistent access without usage anxiety

### Choose Based on Your Project Type

- **Quick Prototypes**: Bolt.new (if budget allows)
- **Next.js Applications**: V0 Vercel  
- **Production Applications**: Cursor AI
- **Full-Stack Integration**: Cursor AI

### The Learning Curve Reality

Each tool has different strengths, and the most effective approach might involve using them in combination:
1. **Planning Phase**: Use AI minimally, focus on clear documentation
2. **UI Development**: V0 for Next.js, Bolt.new for React prototypes
3. **Integration & Production**: Cursor AI for comprehensive development

## Challenges and Limitations

### Common Issues Across All Platforms

**Error Handling**: While all tools can fix errors, the efficiency varies dramatically. Simple syntax errors shouldn't consume significant resources.

**Context Management**: Larger projects challenge all AI tools, though Cursor handles this best through its IDE integration.

**Learning Curve**: Each tool has its optimal usage patterns that require experimentation to discover.

### Platform-Specific Limitations

**Bolt.new**: Token economics make it impractical for large projects
**V0**: Less effective for non-Next.js frameworks and backend integration
**Cursor**: Requires more setup and understanding of IDE-based workflows

## Future Considerations

Based on my experience, the AI development landscape is rapidly evolving. The key is to:
- Stay framework-agnostic in your planning
- Maintain detailed documentation regardless of AI tool choice
- Understand the economics of each platform
- Be prepared to use multiple tools for different phases of development

## Conclusion

My journey with these AI development tools has been transformative. The key insight is that AI tools are amplifiers of human intention and clarity, not replacements for thoughtful planning and architecture. When used appropriately, they can dramatically accelerate development while maintaining code quality.

The most successful approach combines the strengths of each tool: clear documentation and planning (minimal AI), effective UI generation (V0 or Bolt.new), and comprehensive integration and production development (Cursor AI).

For developers starting their AI-assisted development journey, I recommend beginning with clear requirements documentation, experimenting with each tool's strengths, and gradually developing workflows that leverage the best aspects of each platform.
