## Introduction

During my recent project development, I experimented with three major AI development tools: **Bolt.new**, **V0 by Vercel**, and **Cursor AI**. This document captures my hands-on experience with each tool, including what worked, what didn't, and practical insights that could help other developers make informed decisions.

Before diving into the individual tools, let me share the most important lesson I learned: **the quality of your requirements directly determines the quality of AI output**. Don't expect AI to fill in the gaps of poorly defined requirements.

## How I Learned to Prompt Effectively

### Initial Mistakes
At the beginning, I was prompting like this: "I want to create an apartment booking app where the admin can do this and user can do this, these are the conditions." I left out crucial details because I wasn't clear on them myself - like how cancel requests would behave differently for individual bookings versus team bookings. I blindly trusted the AI to handle these gaps, but that approach was fundamentally flawed.

### The Right Approach
**The key insight**: SRS (Software Requirements Specification), requirement documents, and design documents should be done by you with minimal AI assistance. When you create these documents yourself, you identify the areas you're missing rather than leaving it to the AI.

During this requirement and design phase, you can effectively discuss with AI to explore possible solutions and pick which suits your use case better. But the main point is **you should know the problem**. You can't leave it blindly to AI because even if it provides a solution, you won't know what that solution is or how it works.

### My Winning Strategy
After completing all the documents and having clear Figma designs for the UI, I had a complete vision. Since I planned to create the UI using AI, I focused on creating comprehensive API documentation with response structures. I also included coding guidelines like centralized API format where one file would contain all endpoints that could be imported and called from pages.

**Here's how I prompted effectively:**
1. Initially gave the AI the entire concept and basic structure (number of pages and functionalities expected)
2. From the next prompt onward, I provided detailed page specification documents one by one
3. Along with each page spec, I included the endpoints and request/response structures needed
4. For example: for the booking page, I provided an image of the expected UI, detailed feature specifications, and all the endpoints with their request/response formats

**This approach worked the best for me!**

## Tool Comparison and Experiences

### 1. Bolt.new

#### Overview
Bolt.new is an AI-powered full-stack development platform that runs directly in your browser, built on StackBlitz's WebContainers technology.

#### Features
- **AI Code Generation**: Creates functional applications from text prompts
- **Browser-based IDE**: Complete development environment without local setup
- **Framework Support**: Astro, Vite, Next.js, Svelte, Vue, Remix, and more
- **Package Installation**: Can install NPM packages and configure backends
- **Error Detection**: AI assistant monitors and suggests fixes

#### My Experience
Bolt.new is **faster for creating prototypes** and excels at basic React projects, but the UI quality isn't that great. It's excellent for creating basic MVP prototypes but struggles with custom components like layout builders with drag-and-drop features.

The integration capabilities are solid - when I specified endpoints with request/response structures, it handled most integration parts well.

#### Pros
- Fast prototype creation
- Good at handling basic to medium complexity React applications
- Excellent for MVPs and proof-of-concepts
- Handles most API integrations well when provided with clear specifications
- No local setup required

#### Cons
- **Massive token consumption**: This is the biggest issue. The amount of tokens it consumes for the work it does feels unfair
- **Expensive error fixes**: If errors occur (like a missing semicolon or bracket), it can consume 100k+ tokens just to fix simple issues
- **Limited UI customization**: Hard to create custom components and advanced UI features  
- **Version rollback costs tokens**: Unlike V0 where going back to previous versions is free, Bolt charges tokens for rollbacks
- **Token pricing model**: Even pro subscription may not be enough for big projects


**Real Example**: When I had a basic syntax error - something as simple as a missing bracket - Bolt consumed over 100,000 tokens just to identify and fix it. These are errors I could have fixed myself in seconds.

#### When I'd Use It
I would use Bolt.new when I need a **React codebase with basic to medium UI** and I'm only going for an MVP, not a complete project. The pro subscription won't be sufficient for big projects due to heavy token consumption.

### 2. V0 (Vercel)

#### Overview  
V0 by Vercel is an AI-powered UI generator that creates React components with Tailwind CSS, specifically optimized for Next.js applications.

#### Features
- **Text-to-UI Generation**: Creates React components from natural language descriptions
- **Next.js Integration**: Seamlessly works with Next.js framework  
- **Tailwind CSS Styling**: All components come with Tailwind styling
- **Prompt-based System**: Uses prompts instead of token consumption (8 prompts daily on free tier)
- **No Size Limits**: Prompts don't have strict size limitations like token-based systems
- **Component Segmentation**: Can handle multiple tasks in a single prompt if segmented properly

#### My Experience
V0 is **better at handling custom components** and makes fewer errors compared to Bolt.new. When errors do occur, it fixes them without wasting additional prompts.

Since V0 was mainly trained on Next.js, it performs exceptionally well with Next.js projects. The framework-specific training shows - even though Next.js is just a React framework, V0's deep understanding of Next.js patterns makes it superior for that specific use case.

The prompt-based system is more predictable than token-based pricing. You can segregate tasks as "task 1, 2, 3" in a single prompt and it handles them perfectly. It was able to create custom components like layout builders with drag-and-drop features, which Bolt.new struggled with.

#### Pros
- **Predictable pricing**: Prompt-based instead of token-based
- **No prompt size limits**: Can handle large, detailed prompts without extra cost
- **Excellent for Next.js**: Superior performance with Next.js applications
- **Better at custom components**: Successfully handles complex UI components
- **Error handling**: Fixes errors without consuming additional prompts
- **Free rollbacks**: Going back to previous versions doesn't cost extra prompts

#### Cons
- **Framework limitation**: Primarily designed for Next.js (though this is also a strength)
- **Limited integration experience**: Didn't test integration capabilities extensively
- **Front-end focused**: Less confidence in backend development and integration compared to Cursor

#### When I'd Use It
I would choose V0 when I need a **Next.js application** with any level of UI customization. For Next.js projects, it can handle big projects effectively since it shines in that framework.

### 3. Cursor AI

#### Overview
Cursor is an AI-integrated IDE that acts like VS Code with advanced AI capabilities, essentially VS Code with GitHub Copilot on steroids.

#### Features
- **AI-Integrated IDE**: VS Code fork with deep AI integration
- **Project Understanding**: Scans entire directory for context
- **File-specific Integration**: Can add specific files to chat context
- **Code Editing**: Directly edits your codebase  
- **Testing Capabilities**: Can write and run test cases
- **Terminal Access**: Can run applications and test changes
- **Full-stack Support**: Handles both frontend and backend integration

#### My Experience
**Important clarification**: I'm not recommending Cursor for creating full frontend applications from scratch - Bolt.new and V0 are better trained and specialized for initial frontend generation. Instead, **Cursor excels at editing and evolving existing components**.

Here's my actual workflow: I create the initial frontend using V0 or Bolt.new, then download it locally. Once I start working locally and make changes (like changing API responses or renaming "User Profile" to just "Profile"), I face a problem - if I want to add new features using the original web-based tools, I get the old code with the new feature, losing my local changes.

**This is where Cursor shines**: I use Cursor to work on the locally downloaded project to accommodate new features and changes. It's perfect for maintaining and evolving AI-generated code.

**My integration workflow with Cursor:**
1. Create initial frontend with V0/Bolt.new
2. Download and work locally, making various changes
3. Use Cursor for subsequent feature additions and modifications
4. Add relevant files to Cursor chat (e.g., usercontroller.js from backend, login.tsx, AuthProvider.tsx, api.tsx from frontend)
5. Ask it to integrate new features or make modifications
6. Request testing at the end - it writes test cases and runs them
7. If tests fail, it reworks the solution iteratively until success

![Screen Recording 2025-09-30 at 5 51 10Î“Ã‡Â»PM mov](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28a0f198-f661-4203-a336-e40959fb161a)

**Real example**: We had an error where requests were correct and responses were correct, but when we tried to get the response again, it would say data was not found. The issue wasn't in the endpoint but in the schema where we had mistakenly set something to null. Cursor helped identify this schema-level issue that wasn't obvious from API testing.

#### Pros
- **Perfect for code evolution**: Excellent at modifying and enhancing existing codebases
- **Local development workflow**: Works seamlessly with your local development environment
- **Full-stack capability**: Handles both frontend and backend changes seamlessly  
- **Intelligent debugging**: Identifies complex issues across the entire stack
- **Iterative testing**: Keeps testing and refining until it works
- **Project context awareness**: Understands the entire codebase structure
- **Direct code editing**: Makes changes directly to your files
- **Incredible productivity gains**: Can accomplish 2 days of work in 2 hours for modifications and integrations

#### Cons
- **Not ideal for initial frontend creation**: Bolt.new and V0 are better for generating initial UI from scratch
- **Learning curve**: Requires understanding how to work with AI effectively
- **Dependency on clear requirements**: Performance directly correlates with how well you define requirements
- **Can be overwhelming**: The power can be intimidating for beginners, Since if you dive into it without even knowing the stack or basics you will feel lost.

#### When I'd Use It  
Cursor is my go-to tool for **maintaining and evolving AI-generated frontend projects locally**, plus all integration work and full-stack development. It's the perfect bridge between AI-generated initial code and ongoing development needs.

## Conclusion

The optimal approach isn't about choosing one tool - it's about **using each tool for what it does best** and creating a seamless workflow between them.

**Bolt.new** and **V0** excel at initial frontend generation, while **Cursor** is unmatched for evolving and maintaining that code locally. This hybrid approach gives you the best of all worlds: rapid initial development, local control, and powerful ongoing development capabilities.

Most importantly, **invest time in properly defining your requirements**. The quality of AI output is directly proportional to the clarity of your input. No AI tool can compensate for unclear requirements or poorly defined problems.

The future of development isn't about replacing developers - it's about creating intelligent workflows that leverage each tool's strengths. These tools are incredibly powerful when used correctly and in combination, but they require thoughtful application and clear communication to truly shine.
